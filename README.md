## Readme
____



In the past I've made projects where I told myself I would be finished in 1-2 weeks and ended up taking 1-2 months (ie. game jam attempts). This project will be proof to myself that I can create smaller games, which will in turn allow me to focus on developing specific skills.

The skills I will be focusing on in Fintastic Fishing are
-creating feedback that rewards / punishes the players and has the game feel more interactable. <br>
-designing a small core gameplay loop that can be completed in 1-2 weeks. <br>

<br>
<br>

### Game Loop
___
Match the outer ring to the target ring multiple times in a row to catch a fish, collect all the fish to win the game.

### Project Goal
___
This is now a learning project that I intend to use on my portfolio to highlight my ability to:
-create feedback that rewards or punishes the player and increases perceived interactability between the player and game.
-design and implement core gameplay loop, develop MVP in 1-2 weeks.
