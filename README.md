### **Project Goal**
___
In the past I've made projects where I told myself I would be finished in 1-2 weeks and ended up taking 1-2 months (ie. game jam attempts). This project will be proof to myself that I can create smaller games, which will in turn allow me to focus on developing specific skills.
<br>
<br>
The skills I will be focusing on in Fintastic Fishing are: <br> <br>
-applying feedback (using camera, lighting, post processing, particle and sound effects) that reward or punish the player. <br>
-designing a small core gameplay loop that can be developed into an MVP in 1-2 weeks.
